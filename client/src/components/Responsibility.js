          Understanding that litter reduction is a long-term effort, Keep America Beautiful partners
          with businesses large and small to provide educational resources and promote cleaning,
          greening, and beautifying in communities across America.
        </p>
        <p>
          When implemented properly, Reduce, Reuse, & Recycle solutions work to address the sources
          of litter. Our partner’s investments allow us to develop the capacity of our KAB affiliate
          network through improvements in technology, training, skills development, and other
          resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          Together, we work to place our affiliates, volunteers, and corporate partners in a strong
          position to lead change.
