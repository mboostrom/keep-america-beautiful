        <h3>HOW WE CAN END LITTER</h3>
        <h2>The facts on litter are sobering.</h2>
        <p>
          According to our most recent <span className="green">Litter Study</span>, there are more than 50 Billion pieces of litter
          on the ground. Thatâ€™s <span className="green">152 pieces</span> of litter for every American.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there is good news. In the past ten years, littering along <span className="green">US roadways is down 54%!</span>
        </p>
        <p className="last-p">
          And last year alone, over 64,000 clean-up events were held in the US, resulting in over
          146,600 ACRES of parks, public lands, waterways, trails and playgrounds cleaned up by
          volunteers like you.
