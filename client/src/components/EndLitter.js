            You might say, “I’m just one person, what can I do?” Your help matters. When you
            volunteer to help clean up your community, you make a difference. When others see that
            you care for your community, they care too, and over time, behavior changes. Our ongoing
            research shows that an end-to-end process for changing littering behavior through key
            activities like cleaning up public spaces is working. Whether you work by yourself, or
            join a larger movement in your neighborhood, the cleanup is keeping America beautiful.
